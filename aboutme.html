  <h1 class="intro-heading">Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a photographer and designer who is pursuing frontend developement. I love sipping on hot tea, good conversation, and bon fires. I consider myself a full time student in life because growth is a life long process.</p>
  <p>Technology has a special place in my heart. As a little girl my father used to take me to his office and computers would be the size of walls. He told me one day I would be able to fit a computer in the palm of my hand. I did not believe him. Little did I know technolgoy would become my muse. When the first Windows OS came out, I went from door to door in my neighborhood asking if I could install Windows on my everyone's computer. Soon after that Doom because my best friend. Now I am hoping to work on innovative ideas that help others and are visually fulfilling.</p>
 <p>I am very excited to add development to my skill set. I will be finishing the Web Development Career Program with Thinkful in April and look forward to new adventures.</p>

  <h2>Charlotte, North Carolina </h2>
  <p>Charlotte is an awesome city if you enjoy eccentric people, art, and juice bars. Noda, Midwood Plaza, and Southend are some of my favorite areas to hang out. Not far from the beach, a short drive to the mountains, and home of the U.S. National Whitewater Center - there is a plethora of activities at your finger tips. Not to mention, the weather is wonderful all year around.</p>
